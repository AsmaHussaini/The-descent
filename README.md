# The descent
**The procss**

Initialized two variables mountainHmax and target to track the highest mountain height and mountain to be shot respectively.
In the For statement which iterates through each mountain value (i), check If mountainH (height of current mountain) is greater than mountainHmax.

If so, set that value to highest to keep track of the highest of the 7 possible mountains. Secondly, set i to target the index number of the highest mountain.
Then shoot at it, and the loop continues until there are no more mountains.
